# Abstract Licensing Demo

This is a demo that shows minting a legal license on [Abstract](https://docs.abs.xyz). The payment is done with Abstract $ETH, and it mints a license on [Story](https://docs.story.foundation).

This allows developers to integrate licensing into their Abstract apps. For example, this demo shows minting a legal license to have the right to commercialize a song. The license itself costs a small amount of $ETH, and allows the holder to remix and commercialize a song, while preventing AI from training on the song's data.
